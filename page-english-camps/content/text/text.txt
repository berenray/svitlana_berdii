    English camps - are your great opportunity to male your language alive, practice and of course find new friend all around the world.ะบ

    There are same schools, which I belive the best and we are on the same wave:
    - BELS Malta 
    -Cambridge school Istambul
    -Cyprus Language school

    I organize such trips for kids and their parents (and separate) to rest and the same time learn English. 

    If you are interested, write me..
